Prints the status of LED (ON or OFF) with time delays(840ms ON and 520ms OFF).
Blinks an LED connected to GPIO pin 23 of Raspberry Pi.
Cross-compilation of the project to run in Raspberry pi.

**Features**

* Source code organised in multiple directories.
* Separate **release** and **debug** builds.
* Cross-compilation support for Raspberry Pi (aarch64).

**Prerequisites**

* **CMake** â‰¥ 3.10
* **Make**
* **GCC** (for Linux build)
* **aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc** (for Raspberry Pi cross-compilation)
